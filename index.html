                <h2>About prei, pret and paroa.</h2>
                <p>
                    When you're learning Dutch as a foreigner 
                    and try to speak it with real Flemish people
                    after a lot of sweat and tears of learning a 
                    languange with so many exceptions to the grammar rules,
                    you soon discover that people aren't speaking Dutch at all,
                    but Flemish, a weird unintelligble variant. 
                </p><p>
                    And then there's 
                    the dialects. You walk ten minutes and there's, again, an other dialect.
                    As a native speaker I got acquainted with the phenomenon at an
                    age of six, when my west-flemisch dialect speaking parents 
                    decided to move to the Dender region. My mom asked me to buy some leek at 
                    the grocery store. Prei (leek), <em>pret</em>, and <em>paroa</em> are the 
                    same thing, but you don't know that yet as a kid. It took a run back home and 
                    a translation from pret to prei, and later at the grocery store from prei to paroa to finally to be able to 
                    acquire with pride and determination the long sought after vegetable.
                </p><p>    
                    But I guess this event
                    sharpened my intuition for the languages : French, English, German, Music, Mathematics,
                    Basic, C, Matlab, and Java. There is <a href="in-pictures.html"> more to discover about me </a> 
                    in pictures.

                <h2>On radically un-duplicating code</h2>

                <p>
                    One of the things most scorned in the programming community, is code duplication.
                    After some hours of creative development, you should always look critically at your
                    code, and refactor the parts containing the same code fragments. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when you take a very close look at your typical preferred programming language,
                    you might discover that <a href="duplication.html">repetition</a>
                    is sometimes embedded in the core dna of your working
                    tools. Of course, the language creators always have a very good reason for this. But sometimes
                    you wish we didn't have to repeat ourselves. Let's have a look at some Java examples.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Any time I have to write a typical Java line as <em>Thing thing = new Thing(); </em> - this line almost sounds like chuch bells -  my blood
                    pressure starts rising. Although every-thing is needed here when we want to include information
                    pertaining to polymorphism, it really hurts my eyes.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other cases, you create a class with three fields, meant to keep related data together.
                    According to the Java Canon, you're supposed to create getters and setters. Context decides that rudimentary
                    getters and setters suffice for now. With complex classes, the bulk of your class might consist
                    of a quasi endless list of three lines long get and set methods. On top of that in most cases you just need a standard constructor with the three fields, and maybe an empty constructor.
                    The result is that you have to repeat your field name and types four times to configure your class correctly. 
                </p>
                <p> Some people in the Java community discovered a nice solution to some of these inherent
                    repetitions. The <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Lombok project</a>  is a nice example how an "old" programming language keeps evolving,
                    providing tools for writing code more efficiently. Do you also think this is awesome ? Let me know !
